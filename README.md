# Sibling-Identification-Model-Fusion
Project Overview

Face recognition between siblings is challenging due to high similarity and limited variability between faces. While deep learning models like FaceNet and VGGFace perform well in general face recognition tasks, they are often insufficient for sibling identification, especially in distinguishing subtle regional facial differences.

This project proposes a hybrid approach by fusing feature embeddings from FaceNet and VGGFace. By leveraging their complementary strengths, we create a composite feature vector per image and calculate cosine similarity for classification.
